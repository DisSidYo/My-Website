		      <h3> Breaking some ice!</h3>
		
		     
			
			<p>I am Siddharth Swapnil Wani, and I am an international student from India.
            I am studying Bachelor of Computing Science (honours) here at UTS. Moving 
			to a new Country, new Continent, new Hemisphere altogether can be pretty scary, 
			believe me! But it is alright, because I have got loads of help from family, 
		 	friends, and faculty. 
			 <p/>
			 
                  <h3> A deeper look into me</h3>
		    <p>  Socializing, one of the many important life-skills, isn't exactly my forte.
			  But I am working on it, so that I can enhance my Uni-Experience. Programming 
			 in general is my hobby (not because I excel at it, but because it excites me). I 
			  like having new experiences - recently I went to a live cricket match for 
			  the very first time in my life and had tonnes of fun! Also, I love trying new 
			  cuisines. So if you are in the mood to try new stuff, remember, you got yourself a partner.
