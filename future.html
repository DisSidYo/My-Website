            Being through so much in this pandemic, I reckon everyone wants
			 some sort respite from the feeling of loneliness. I want to make
			 lots of friends and connections, expand my network, travel and explore 
			 places and obviously make the most out of my Uni-Experience. I want to gain practical 
			 work experience in my undergrad as well, as it is vital for anybody 
			 looking to work in IT. 
			 <p>
			 Most importantly, I want to decide my major. UTS provides an opportunity to
			 select majors from a pool of options, so it is very important for me 
			 to choose the one I like. Doing something that genuinely gives me pleasure and 
			 satisfaction is my ultimate goal.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 Also, being an international student, finances are obviously a bit burdening. I
			 want to get as much scholarship as possible, and also some kind of a part-time job 
			 to lessen the load on my parents.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 I want to ensure that my Uni-Days are the most colorful days of my life.
			 I want to learn, I want to grow, I want to achieve, and last but not the least,
			 I want to make my family proud.
